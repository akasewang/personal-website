        i&apos;m a data science undergrad with a strong interest in deep learning, competitive programming, and web development. I enjoy building projects from the ground up and often find myself diving into research papers just to satisfy my curiosity.

        outside of tech, I like playing chess, sketching whatever comes to mind, and exploring photography. Whether it's capturing light through a lens or solving a tricky puzzle on the board, Iâ€™m always up for something creative or challenging.
